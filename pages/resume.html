    <h2>School</h2>
    <p> I spent all of my years in the Hempfield School District where I graduated in 2017 with a 3.8 GPA.
    </p>

    <p> My years at Hempfield were spent mostly in the study of Communications and how to interact with people in a regular conversation or even in an interview.
    </p>

    <p> I am now at Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology studying Computer Software Engineering Technology. I am set to graduate from here with a 2-year Associates Degree in May of 2020.

    <h2>Work Skills </h2>
    <p> I work well with others in team projects and partner projects. I can also work by myself whenever needed.
    </p>

    <p> I have great communications skills where ever I am. It can be a one on one conversation, a small group conversation or even a big presentation in front of many people. I am comfortable with truly any in person communications.
    </p>

    <p> I can adapt with changes that are put into the mix of any day. This means if someone doesn’t show up and they were supposed to, I can adjust so that doesn’t have a major effect on our day.
    </p>

    <p> I have great time management skills and also can work under pressure. Both of them come hand in hand when I was in Public Communications. I would only have so much time to get the project done and it had to be done by a certain date in the
      near future.
