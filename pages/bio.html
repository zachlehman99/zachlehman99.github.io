  <article class="first">

    <h3 class="school"> School </h3>
    <p>I was born and raised in Lancaster, Pa and grew up in East Petersburg, Pa. I went the Hempfield School District and graduated from there in 2017. I took a semester off to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I started at Thaddeus
      Stevens College of Technology in January of 2018. I was just doing general education classes for the first semester and when the 2018-19 school year started I started my major and also some general education classes. My major is Computer
      Software Engineering Technology and I am to graduate in 2020.

    <h3> Personal </h3>
    <p>When I am outside of school I enjoy many kinds of sports. I love to watch baseball, hockey, tennis and so much more. I watch all of these sports with my parents and my one brother. I also really love playing tennis with my brother in my free
      time. I really enjoy being outside and enjoying the fresh air in Lancaster County.
    </p>

    <p> I also have many hobbies outside of all of the sports that I play and watch. I really enjoy collecting sports cards and also, I love collecting American coins. My dad really loves collecting coins and my brother and I collect sports cards.
      Those are the hobbies that make me who I am.
