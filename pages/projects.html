    <p class="project-p">This shows that I know how to set up a form on the html side of things. It is a simplistic page that is almost set up as a blog. This was made on a Sunday afternoon that I had nothing to do, so I made a very nice page of
      content.

    <p class="project-p">This project is just a project that is focusing on borders, the parts of the Nav bar and the idea of some positioning. This is a very colorful project and it has one complete page of content. The links do work in the Nav bar
      too. I hope you
      enjoy this project!

    <p class="project-p">This project is centered around color, backgrounds and changing with the radius of a picture or border. This a simplistic page that has backgrounds on individual paragraphs, also applying a different font on one of the
      paragraphs and applying
      color to one of the paragraphs too.
