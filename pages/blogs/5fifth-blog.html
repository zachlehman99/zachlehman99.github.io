    <h1 class="blog-title">Don't Hurry Through Life </h1>

    <p> I know I haven’t written anything in a long time, but to be honest I have been busy with school and work, so I have not written anything lately. This led me to one topic that it seems like many people worry about way too much and that is how
      life always seems fast. It doesn’t matter what age you are, life seems to breeze by, like when kids go through elementary school and middle school and high school it just flies by in a minute. This is also true when anyone shops for the
      holidays, it seems like everyone is in a hurry and wants to get all the deals. It is the same idea because they think the time from now till the holiday, they celebrate is just going to creep up on them. I just do not see the point of hurrying
      up and I will tell you why.
    </p>

    <p> I know I have said in past blogs that I hate quotes, but I do want to use a quote for this, as said by Shikamaru Nara “There's no advantage to hurrying through life.". This statement is so true, everyone says school flies by and it always
      seems like they want it to happen, but you do have to slow down for just a moment and enjoy what is happening. If you do not enjoy it then what is the purpose of going through school if it just ends up being hell. I mean if their doing school
      to get a job that pays a ton of money and they do not like it then yeah, I guess seeing them wanting it to go fast would make sense. The only thing that would not make sense in that plan is why are they going to school for a job they do not
      like just for money. </p>

    <p> That could also make people want things to hurry up in their life because they hate their job. I mean if they want things to speed up because they hate their job, they really should be doing something else. All I am trying to say about the
      school aspect and the job aspect is that if you like what you are doing, everything will speed up naturally and not speed up because you want it too. I know this does not cover everyone because there are many people who love their job and so
      much more.
    </p>

    <p> That was just somewhat the idea of rambling through stuff. I bring this up because of all the holiday shoppers out there wanting things to go by fast so they can find the best deals and so that they can get the hell out of the stores. I see
      where they are coming from, but why do they want to get out of stores. In my opinion it seems like most people cram shopping for things into one month of the year and that makes no sense too me. If everyone would spread the shopping out
      throughout the year than in the long term, there could be better deals. I say that because does anyone really know what Black Friday even means…like the term of black? The meaning of it is this was the time of year all stores would be in the
      black for the year…or in layman’s terms it was when they were making money or a profit. Now it seems like stores in malls and other such things do it, so they can stay afloat for at least another year. Times have changed.
    </p>

    <p> This all goes back to the idea of shopping throughout the year, it may be more expensive to buy something in July instead of the end of November, but it makes things much easier. I may be crazy, but if you’re not stressing about things
      during the holiday season then you do not have to worry about the time flying by. It is very helpful to do and just plan out at the beginning of the year, but you can always plan to do it next year.
    </p>

    <p> I really never want to hurry through life because you may end up missing something that may have been really important to the meaning of your life. Just enjoy it as it goes by and don’t ever hinder on the past because I mean you really can’t
      change it, but you can form your future.
    </p>
