      <h1 class="blog-title">Take Nothing for Granite</h1>

      <p>This blog will be a little different than the past couple, this will basically be about some of the things that are happening around me at the moment. This past week is very hard to put into words because everything has changed in school and outside of school. I am not going to say anything about my school stuff because most people would not care that much at all which I am completely fine with. I am just going to talk about this past weekend before Halloween...Just hear me out. </p>

      <p>Things got hard for a school that I live really close to and I know some people that go there and have gone and graduated from there also. Everything got hard because there was a very big 8 car accident basically right in front of the school. At the moment when I am writing this, two students have died because of this incident and others are still in the hospital. The whole town where it happened at a quick glance from outside of the community, they seem to be a very close bunch of people and I respect that, and I wish everywhere was that close. It is hard to write on something like this because it is hard to get an actual perspective on things. </p>

      <p>This is a tough situation and there are ways to recover from everything that happened, it will take time and lots of struggling to get through it. All of this is depressing, and this tragic event is hard to hear on the news and see on the news. I want to try and help with words that I have and maybe with some luck, some of my word will help someone. It can be 1 person, that would be an accomplishment. I hope it can be more.</p>

      <p>The problem with recovering from this is that people will feel like they are missing a part of their family or they are missing a dear friend or even that they are missing a community member. I can almost relate because a girl in my graduating class died last year from getting hit by a car when she was at college. It was hard on everyone that knew her and the magnitude of people that she affected when she was here. I somewhat understand the idea of losing someone way too early, but I can't compare things because that is not what this is for. I can relay some things that can help some people recover from this tragedy and become a stronger person and a stronger community because of it. Just keep reading and I will try and help and get some ideas out there.</p>

      <p>The first idea is that it will be painful and there is going to be a lot of feelings going around in your brain and basically everywhere. The one thing is you do not want to hold your feelings back and do not hold feelings in you. I am a guy and I know guys like to cover up true feelings, and in this case, it is not good to do so. If you are in pain, let people around you know about it. It will be hard, and I know it will, but talk to a friend, talk to your family how you feel. It will help you release everything and it will help you try and recover from everything, that is going on in life. This is not a cure all, some people do not like talking about their feelings, but there are other ways to try and ease the pain of the losses. </p>

      <p>I also think if you surround yourself with loving friends and family it will make dealing with the situation a little bit easier than trying to do it alone. It doesn't matter the age of yourself, you can find some way to get help from friends and family. If you are away at a faraway college or job and you are feeling down and out because of this incident, you can talk to any of your friends there. If they are true friends, they will help you through your situation. You truly don't have to talk about your feelings right away because in this situation you are surrounded by friends and family and you are already comfortable around them and this leads to talking deeply with them at some point. That can help soothe the situation that is going around in your brain.  </p>

      <p>One thing that has always worked for me when times are tough, and you think they are never going to get better is that you should do something to get your mind off things for a little bit. It maybe playing a sport, playing video games, reading a book, yelling outside or basically anything. This can release stress and also help the process of healing. This is not a long-term help, but it can be helpful and can be used to ease into another way of recovering from this.</p>

      <p>The hardest one by far is the idea that life lives on even after they pass. This is just so hard to put out there, but it can be very helpful. Anyone that dies unexpectedly, always puts that awful feeling in the stomachs of people that knew them the best. When anyone is alive, they don't want to put a burden on anyone at any time in their life. That is human nature that people do not want to be burdens on anyone. The people who die unexpectedly in this world probably don't want it to be a burden on their family and friends. They would want them to live their life to the fullest potential. This point takes a while to actually get to, but when anyone gets to this point, they will be able to find a place that is better for their mind set of things.</p>

      <p>All of this can help when dealing with a situation like this. My heart goes out to everyone affected by this tragic event. I know it may seem at this point that it will never happen, but things will get better, things always get better. All of this may take time and more time, but things will get better. I actually wrote this, but I am actually here if someone wants to talk and truly if anyone wants to yell their feelings out or anything like that, I am here. </p>
