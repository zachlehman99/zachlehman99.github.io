    <h1 class="blog-title">Nerves before, during and after a speech, but why?</h1>

    <p> People always try and tell themselves that they are not nervous for a speech or a presentation in public, but it is almost guaranteed that everybody should have some nerves doing and preparing for a speech. Nerves are actually making you
      feel upset in the stomach or there trying to give you excuses not to do something. There are people that have the preparation nerves and people like that have a tough time actually trying to complete their speech on time and show up for their
      date to do their speech. I mean I have never truly had that feeling because for me it use to be the during the speech kind of nerves.
    </p>

    <p> I really do not know how to help the preparation nerves besides just trying to focus on the speech as just homework and nothing else. It is just plain homework or a project that is due on a certain day. That is the way I would tackle things
      if I had that kind of nervousness for preparing for a speech. Then there are those kinds of people that truly hate the day of the speech. They are sitting there waiting their turn to go and while they are watching others go before them it
      starts to set in. This kind of nervousness is common and happens a lot of times because us as humans are comparing are speech to everyone else’s speech in our mind. Which is good and bad at the same time as a human being.
    </p>

    <p> I say that because we as humans always want to show up other people and we want to be better, so it is natural that we compare our speech to other speeches within the class. The way I would handle this is try your hardest not to compare
      yourself to anyone else. That is a very hard thing to do and you should also feel proud of what you have done and achieved while doing your speech. You can also think of ways that you can think of giving a speech not as a competition, but as a
      learning experience. Learn from your peers and do not compare yourself to them as better or worse and just try and give your speech so if you have accomplished something great others can learn from you.
    </p>

    <p> Then I would have to say probably the most common kind of nerves are nerves that happen when you are giving your speech. Many people encounter this kind of nerves, so if you have them you are not alone, and even high-quality speakers get
      this feeling sometimes. This is commonly known as stage fright because all you are scared of is when you are up there while you are giving your speech is when you are actually scared. This can be solved by the old standby…picturing the
      audience in their underwear which to me is complete bs, but if it helps do it. I would always say to myself that most of the time these people are complete strangers and if you mess up, they will not really know unless you tell them. If it
      turns out that you have to give a speech in front of friends like for a class in school or something, then all you have to think is that they will more than liking have to do the same thing at one point.
    </p>

    <p> They will have to give a speech and if they make fun of you for messing up, they always have to view it as that they still have to give a speech and they have time to mess up too. Nobody is perfect, and nobody will ever be perfect. Every
      person that speaks in front of a body of people will mess up at some point in their career, it may not be today or tomorrow, but everyone messes up and nobody should be scared of messing in front of people it’s life. These nerves are always
      good, and I have always heard that nerves mean you care about what you are doing. If you do not have any sort of nerves, then it is almost like you don’t care about what you are doing.

    <p> I hope all of this makes sense and if anyone has any questions just go back to my contact page and shoot me a message and I will hope to answer it for you or we can find out together. Talk next time and enjoy life everyone.
