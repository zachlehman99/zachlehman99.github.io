    <h1 class="blog-title">Stress can be positive...maybe?</h1>

    <p>I am Zach Lehman as you should know by now, but I guess there could be a chance you do not know my name. This past week at Thaddeus Stevens for the first years in Computer Software we have been doing this website. I have to say for some
      people
      this project has been stressful as hell, but for some people it has not been that stressful. I have to say I am in the middle of that, I cannot say that I am completely stressed out or that I am not stressed out and here is why.</p>

    <p>First of all I have my whole class, right beside me struggling with me. That has eased the stress because we are all there struggling. We are all in the same position and we as a class will figure it out together. I also think people could be
      struggling because they are afraid of asking any questions to the Professor or even to a friend or partner. I have to say when I showed up the first day I was like that, I was sort of scared of asking anyone anything in the first week because
      I
      thought they would look down upon me for not knowing anything. </p>

    <p>One thing that I have learned is that nobody knows everything in their field and I do not think someone should know everything in their field. You should never be stressed out because you cannot ask a question about something you do not know.
    </p>

    <p>This centers around stress, but I have not talked much about stress during this blog and I am really not wondering why. The reason is that writing everything out and talking about all of the stress that is out there basically deletes all of
      the
      stress I possible could have at one moment in the day. All I am saying is even if you are stressed, you can find something that is a great stress reliever for you as a single person. This will differ from person to person and even day to day
      for
      a single person.</p>

    <p>The stress will only get worse because of the actual midterm test we have on Friday or life in general. Life is way too stressful sometimes and yet people find a way to get through the day. To me stress is a positive thing in your life
      because I think without stress you do not really care about what you are doing with your life. If someone was not stressed about our midterm project they would be a liar, or they do not care enough to be stressed. I am not calling anyone out,
      but
      I mean if someone did not have stress and you really cared about the project, I would want to know what you are doing to achieve it.
    </p>

    <p>That is why I think it is a positive thing to have stress in your daily life. I am not a person to quote someone to back up my point, I just put my point out there for people to view it and take it in. To summarize everything is that I think
      stress is positive, but also negative just depending on how you use it and handle it. I hope you enjoyed this blog and comeback for another blog in the coming future.
