    <h1 class="blog-title">This is my first blog </h1>

    <p> This is the first time I have ever thought about doing this, but it just feels right. I say that because I really like putting my thoughts out there in writing. I would not say I am the greatest at it, but it is fun and it is a release of
      whatever is on your mind.
    </p>

    <p> My intial thought on blogging was I can't do this and I will never be able to do this and yet I am still attempting this. I really do not want this to be drawn out or anything like that, but I do want it to be a place where I can share my
      thoughts.
    </p>

    <p> This first blog will be short and sweet. I hope whoever is reading this will wait and come back in the near future to read an actual blog. It will definently be way more interesting than me just telling you what I will be doing. I hope to
      see
      you back for blog number 2.
